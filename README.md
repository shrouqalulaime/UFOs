# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The project aims to create a webpage that provides information about UFO events and a dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria, such as date, city, state, country, and shape. In this project, HTML and Javascript will be used. 

## Results
The table data provided on the webpage can be manipulated and filtered using many search criteria added to the left side of the webpage, as shown in the image below.

Five primary filters are added: date, city, state, country, and shape. The filters show an example of the user input. For example, the date filter can be entered in 1/10/2010 format. The user can follow these formats to enter the search criteria of interest. For instance, if the user is looking for Benton city and a circle shape as below. Based on those search criteria, only one row is matched, and the table is filtered accordingly.

Another example is if a user is only looking for UFOs in California State. Again, the table is adjusted based on user preference.

To reset to the full original table, the user needs to click on "UFO Sightings" on the left top of the webpage, as shown below.

## Summary
The drawback of the current webpage, it needs to provide a visualization for the analysis. To further improve the webpage design, the filtered data might be summarized with appropriate visualization plots, such as adding a bar chart showing the number of UFOs per state or city. Another improvement might be ranking the search result based on user preference. For example, the user might be interested in seeing the most recent events on top or short-duration events.
